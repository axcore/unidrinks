## Latest release: v1.0.0 (24 December 2025) (see recent [changes](CHANGES.txt))

[unilib](https://github.com/axcore/unilib) is a mod for all Minetest-compatible engines, including [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/).

[unidrinks](https://github.com/axcore/unidrinks) is an expansion pack for **unilib**, providing (mostly) alchoholic drinks and related items from the following mods:

* [bbq](https://github.com/Grizzly-Adam/BBQ) - imported only beer (used by the **bbq_extra** remix); all other material from the **bbq** mod appears in unilib itself (in the **bbq** remix)
* [wine](https://codeberg.org/tenplus1/wine) - imported everything

<u>This mod is rated as 18+</u>. It provides alcoholic drinks, but there are no intoxication effects. At their parents' discretion, this mod *might* be suitable for some younger players.
